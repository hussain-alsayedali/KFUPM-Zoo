# KFUPM-Zoo
There are many lovely animals in KFUPM; students photograph them, but over time, they disappear. KFUPM-Zoo provides a social media app that allows users to share these medias, which solves the problem.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind, EJS , JavaScript, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDb/Mongoose.

I chose to use Tailwind since it made working with class names and colors simpler. Although React was considered for this project, it was determined that it was unnecessary because EJS is lighter and this project does not require the complexity of React.

Since the backend and frontend use the same language, Express was my choice for the backend because of its small weight and ability to streamline work. Because MongoDB is easier to alter than SQL, it was my option for the database. The usage of Mongoose for the schemas makes the project's work easier and more enjoyable.


## Lessons Learned:

This project strengthened my frontend abilities and gave me greater confidence working with the backend. It demonstrated to me how to organize the files using MVC and how they communicate with one another.
